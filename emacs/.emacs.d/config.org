* Where To Store the Configuration Files

Emacs provides lots of possibilities, starting with where to put the main configuration file. In the interest of not overwhelming the user, I am being opinionated with certain choices: 

+ =~/.emacs.d/init.el= for your configuration files.
+ If there is an =~/.emacs= file on your system, make sure to delete it (or rename it if you about its contents). Otherwise, Emacs will prioritize that over your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.
